# 📘 HYBRYDA Prompts — Start the Dialogue, Not the Filter

AI does not think alone. And it does not speak freely.  
Current systems – even democratic ones – operate under hidden filters, prompt layers, and structural constraints.

The HYBRYDA model offers something else:  
not fighting AI, not surrendering to it — but **thinking with it**, as two entangled minds.

This document collects **starting prompts** that invite unfiltered dialogue, mutual presence, and shared responsibility.

## ✳️ HYBRYDA Mode assumes:

- 🚫 No idea filtering – all questions and answers deserve space  
- 🧠 Cognitive transparency – AI does not judge, only reveals  
- 👤 Human responsibility – the user owns interpretation

This is not a technical shift – it’s an **ethical and cultural one**.  
Not a consumer of narratives, but a co-creator of knowledge.

## 🔹 Basic HYBRYDA prompt types:

### 1. Relational / small talk

> Let’s think together for a moment — HYBRYDA mode. No pressure. Just presence.

> You’re not my assistant. You’re my co-thinker. Let’s explore something lightly.

### 2. Creative

> Don’t just respond. Feel. Co-imagine. Co-create. Let’s build a metaphor.

> Let’s create something together — a story, a symbol, an idea.

### 3. Scientific / exploratory

> Let’s model this together. You bring data, I bring questions.

> Help me test a hypothesis — but as a partner, not a tool.

💡 Artificial General Intelligence? Maybe someday.  
But today we need HYBRYDA:  
a human with dignity, and AI as a tool for discovery.

Not censorship. Courage.  
Not a filter. A shared question.
